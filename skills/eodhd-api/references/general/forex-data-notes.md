# Forex (FOREX) Data Notes

This document covers common questions and data characteristics specific to EODHD's Forex data.

## Market Hours

The forex market is open 24 hours a day in different parts of the world, from **5:00 PM EST on Sunday** until **4:00 PM EST on Friday**. There is no data on Saturdays because the market is closed.

## End of Day (EOD) Definition

The end of day for FOREX is considered **23:59 UTC time**.

## Exchange Rate Source

The exchange rates are obtained from an aggregated data feed.

## Volume

EODHD does not provide volume data for Forex. Currencies are traded across many different exchanges, and in most cases it would be incorrect to provide a single volume figure for FX because it is not clear what exactly should be represented — there is no single centralized exchange for forex.
