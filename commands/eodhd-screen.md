Screen stocks using EODHD screener based on these criteria: $ARGUMENTS

Translate the user's criteria into EODHD screener filters.

**Filter format (critical):** `filters` is a **JSON array of `[field, operation, value]` triples**, NOT
dot-notation and NOT a JSON object. A JSON object is rejected with HTTP 422 ("must be an array").
Operations: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `match`.

**Sort format:** `--sort field.direction`, e.g. `market_capitalization.desc` or `pe.asc`. A bare field name
(or a separate order flag) is rejected with HTTP 422 ("sort.0.direction is required").

**Currency caveat (important):** absolute-money fields — `market_capitalization`, `revenue`, `ebitda` — are
reported in each listing's **local currency**, not normalized to USD. So a raw threshold leaks huge non-USD
companies (e.g. a Vietnam-listed firm shows "3.88T" ₫ ≈ $150M but passes a `>= 10B` filter). Each result row
carries a `currency_symbol` field telling you the currency. Therefore:
- When filtering/sorting by an absolute-money field, **scope to one market** — add `["exchange","=","us"]`
  (or the user's intended exchange) so the threshold is currency-consistent.
- For multi-market screens, you cannot compare raw caps across rows — group/label by `currency_symbol`.
- Ratio/percent fields (`pe`, `pb`, `ps`, `peg`, `roe`, `roa`, `beta`, `dividend_yield`) are currency-independent and safe to compare across markets.

Common mappings (note: `dividend_yield` is a **fraction** — 0.03 = 3%):
- "large cap" → `["market_capitalization",">=",10000000000]`
- "mid cap" → `["market_capitalization",">=",2000000000],["market_capitalization","<=",10000000000]`
- "small cap" → `["market_capitalization","<=",2000000000]`
- "high dividend" → `["dividend_yield",">=",0.03]`
- "low P/E" or "cheap" → `["pe",">",0],["pe","<",15]` + `--sort pe.asc`
- "tech" → `["sector","=","Technology"]`
- "healthcare" → `["sector","=","Healthcare"]`
- US stocks → `["exchange","=","us"]` (recommended whenever filtering by market cap)
- Sector names, industry names, exchange codes as additional `[field,"=",value]` triples

Example: "high dividend large cap (US)" →
`--filters '[["dividend_yield",">=",0.03],["market_capitalization",">=",10000000000],["exchange","=","us"]]' --sort market_capitalization.desc`

Use the `stock-screener` skill workflow:
1. Run screener with translated filters (limit 20)
2. For top 5-10 results, fetch fundamentals for deeper detail
3. Fetch recent price data for performance context

Present:
- **Filters Applied** — show the JSON filter used
- **Results Table** — ticker, name, sector, market cap (with its `currency_symbol`), P/E, dividend yield, price, 30d change. Show the currency next to any cap/revenue figure; never present a non-USD cap as if it were USD.
- **Top 5 Deep Dive** — expanded valuation and growth metrics for best matches
- **Summary** — key themes and patterns in results

If criteria are vague, ask for clarification or suggest reasonable defaults.
